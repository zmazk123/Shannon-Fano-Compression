# Shannon-Fano Compression

This program is a GUI implementation of Shannon-Fano Coding. I made it with an intent to lean wxWidgets, a cross-platform C++ GUI library. And I also wanted to see how threads behave in this enviorment. So if you want to compile the program yourself you will need do include wxWidgets. Shannon-Fano assigns a code to every symbol based on it's frequency. If a sybmol appears more often it's code is shorter.

You can download the program [here](https://github.com/zmazk123/Shannon-Fano-Compression/blob/master/Release/ShannonFano%20Compression.exe?raw=true).
